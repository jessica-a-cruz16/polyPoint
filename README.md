# Polygon/Point Overlap Detection Tool

The purpose of the tool is to detect when spatial point and polygon entries overlap for the same NID. A codebook from the geospatial directory is entered and (if applicable) a list of affected NIDs are returned along with infographs and actionable insights for analysts to use to remedy the issue.
